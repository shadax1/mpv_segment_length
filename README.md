# mpv_segment_length

mpv script that displays the length of a segment from point A to point B in a video.

## How to install

Download `mpv_segment_length.lua` and place it inside your mpv scripts folder.
Scripts are usually placed in:
| OS | Location |
| --- | --- |
| GNU/Linux or macOS | `~/.config/mpv/scripts/` |
| Windows | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/scripts/` |

## How to use

Once the script is placed in the scripts folder, open a video, go anywhere in the video and use `Ctrl+z` to set the starting of point of the segment. Then you can move at any point after that to see how long the segment is.
Finally, you can use `Ctrl+x` to remove the displayed text.
