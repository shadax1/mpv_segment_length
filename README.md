# mpv_segment_length

mpv script that displays the length of a segment from point A to point B in a video.

## How to install

Download `mpv_segment_length.lua` and place it inside your mpv scripts folder.
On Windows, it should be inside `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\mpv\scripts` and on Linux, it should be inside `~/.config/mpv/scripts/`.
For more info about the scripts folder location, check the [mpv documentation](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#script-location)

## How to use

Once the file is placed in the scripts folder, open a video, go anywhere in the video and use `Ctrl+z` to set the starting of point of the segment. Then you can move at any point after that to see how long the segment is.
Finally, you can use `Ctrl+x` to remove the displayed text.
